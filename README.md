# Pokémon FireRed Progress Tracker

An interactive tracker built to support a **100% completion + Living Dex** run of Pokémon FireRed Version (Game Boy Advance).

---

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `firered-area-tracker-v3.jsx` | Main tracker (web) — v3 visual redesign rendered by `index.html` |
| `firered-area-tracker-v2.jsx` | Previous version — kept as reference/fallback |
| `firered-area-tracker.jsx` | Original version — kept as a React artifact fallback for Claude.ai |
| `firered-walkthrough-tracker.jsx` | Simpler walkthrough milestone checklist + 151-Pokémon Living Dex grid |
| `index.html` | Web entry point — loads DM Sans from Google Fonts and renders v3 |

---

## Hosting

The tracker is designed to run as a **static web page** hosted on Cloudflare Pages (or any static host), as well as a React artifact inside [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

### Running locally

Serve the project directory with Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`. A local server is required — opening `index.html` directly as a `file://` URL will fail because the browser blocks loading the `.jsx` file via fetch.

### Cloudflare Pages deployment

Connect the GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages with no build command and no output directory. Add a custom subdomain via **Workers & Pages → Custom domains** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Features

- **FR / LG version toggle** — declare your version in the header; accent color switches between FireRed orange and LeafGreen green, and the other version's exclusive encounters dim automatically
- **Gym badge strip** — eight clickable badge icons in the header; earned badges glow and persist across sessions
- **Areas tab** — audited areas covering Pallet Town through Fuchsia City (Parts 1–10), each with:
  - All wild Pokémon encounters with sprites, encounter rates, and FR / LG differences noted
  - All obtainable items with sprites — both visible and hidden (★ = requires Itemfinder)
  - All trainers with trainer class sprites and full Pokémon teams (species, sprite, and level), checkable as defeated
  - FireRed-exclusive and LeafGreen-exclusive tags on relevant encounters
  - Warnings on one-time-only encounters (Snorlax ×2, legendaries, etc.)
  - Multi-floor areas (Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel, S.S. Anne, Safari Zone, etc.) organised floor-by-floor with collapsible sections
  - Mark-all / clear buttons on each section header
  - Area-type color coding in the sidebar (route / cave / water / safari / special / city)
  - ← → navigation arrows in the area detail header for sequential stepping
- **Pokédex tab** — full 151-Pokémon grid with sprites; uncaught Pokémon shown as black silhouettes; click any Pokémon to see its caught status and every area it appears in
- **Living Dex panel** — collapsible panel listing trade evolutions, fossil choices, Fighting Dojo, version exclusives, and event Pokémon with their caught state
- **Shared Pokémon state** — catching a Pokémon in any area marks it caught everywhere, including the Pokédex tab
- **Progress saved automatically** between sessions via browser localStorage

## Audit status

Area data is being audited part by part against the [Bulbapedia FireRed & LeafGreen walkthrough](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Walkthrough:Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen). Only audited parts are shown in the tracker.

## Living Dex notes

A Living Dex means having one of every Pokémon obtained and stored — all 151 in this case, before migrating to Pokémon HOME.

Key things to plan around:

- **Fossil choice** — you can only pick one fossil in Mt. Moon per playthrough (Dome → Kabuto, Helix → Omanyte). Trade for the other.
- **Fighting Dojo** — you can only receive Hitmonlee *or* Hitmonchan. Trade for the other.
- **Version exclusives** — FireRed and LeafGreen each have ~15 Pokémon the other version can't catch. All are flagged `FR` or `LG` in the tracker. Trading with a LeafGreen save is required.
- **Trade evolutions** — Alakazam, Gengar, Machamp, and Golem each require a trade to evolve.
- **Mew** — event-only and not obtainable through normal gameplay. Not flagged as catchable anywhere in this tracker.
- **HOME migration path** — FireRed → Pal Park (Gen IV) → Pokémon Bank (3DS) → Pokémon HOME.

## Design (v3)

The web version (`firered-area-tracker-v3.jsx`) introduces a dual-version identity system and several visual improvements:

- **Palette** — deep warm near-black backgrounds (`#110d08`) with a dynamic accent: FireRed orange `#d4621a` or LeafGreen green `#3fa84a`, switching via a header toggle and applied via CSS custom property `--frlg-accent`
- **Typography** — [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) (400/600/700) for all UI text; Courier New kept only for Pokédex numbers
- **Silhouettes** — uncaught Pokémon sprites render as full black silhouettes (`brightness(0)`) at reduced opacity, faithful to the in-game Pokédex
- **Encounter rate tiers** — sky blue ≥ 30%, golden yellow ≥ 10%, soft violet < 10%; split FR/LG rates rendered as stacked color-coded pill badges
- **Area-type sidebar colors** — routes (green), caves/forests/towers (tan), water/ships (blue), Safari Zone (bright green), special areas (violet), cities (gold)
- **Collapsible floor sections** — multi-floor areas show a collapse toggle on each floor divider with done/total count
- **Mark-all buttons** — each section header (Wild Pokémon / Items / Trainers) includes a one-click mark-all / clear button

The v2 file (`firered-area-tracker-v2.jsx`) is kept as a reference. localStorage keys are compatible between versions — save data carries over.

## Technical notes

- Built with **React 18** (hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)
- In-browser JSX transpilation via **Babel standalone** loaded from CDN — no build tools required
- All encounter and item data is hardcoded; no API calls, instant load
- Encounter rates sourced from Bulbapedia; Pokémon availability is accurate for audited parts
- Persistent storage uses `localStorage`
- Pokémon and item sprites served from [PokeAPI sprites](https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites) via GitHub raw CDN
- Trainer sprites served from [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/trainers/)
